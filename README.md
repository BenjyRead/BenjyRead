## Hello, I'm Benjy

I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Cardiff, and have been programming for almost a decade. I have experience working with a variety of clients including Cybersecurity firms, NHS trusts, and small businesses.

My best programming languages are Python, Rust, Kotlin, and Typescript, but I have experience in a wide variety of languages, technologies and disciplines.
